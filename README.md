## About

This repository focuses on providing Power BI assets (DAX code, themes, and visualizations) that can be applied to career center-related reports, such as student engagement tracking, employer activity, and event attendance. Career centers can use these tools to improve their reporting, helping to drive insights and support decision-making.

## Current Files

### DAX_Date_Table.txt

This file contains a DAX formula that generates a **Date Table** for Power BI. A Date Table is essential for time intelligence calculations such as year-over-year comparisons, semester-based reports, and tracking student engagement across different periods.

Key features of this Date Table:
- **Dynamic Date Range**: Set the start and end years.
- **Semester Calculations**: Automatically splits the year into Spring, Summer, and Fall semesters.
- **Academic Year Logic**: Tracks the academic year (Julyâ€“June).
- **Other Date Info**: Includes year, month, quarter, week number, and more.

### BaylorBrandTheme.json

This JSON file contains a custom **Power BI theme** based on Baylor University's branding. It provides:
- **Color Palette**: A set of official Baylor colors for consistent visual presentation.
- **Background and Foreground Colors**: Ensures a professional and branded look for reports.
- **Table Accent**: Highlight tables with Baylor's signature colors.
